# Issue: Missing Environment Variable Causes Application Crash  

## Description  
Applications often rely on environment variables for configuration (e.g., `DATABASE_URL` for database connections). If a required variable is missing or misconfigured, the application fails on startup, enters `CrashLoopBackOff`, and becomes unavailable.  

## Impact  
- **Failure to Start** → Application exits immediately due to a missing critical config.  
- **Deployment Failure** → Kubernetes continuously restarts the pod, leading to `CrashLoopBackOff`.  
- **Manual Intervention Required** → Engineers must fix missing configs manually, causing delays and downtime.  

## How Our Self-Healing System Fixes It  
- Detects missing environment variables from logs & anomalies.  
- Applies temporary fallback values or requests secret rotation.  
- Prevents deployment if required configs are missing to avoid crashes.  
- Alerts engineers before failure escalates, reducing downtime.
